Kick Assembler (C64) For Visual Studio Code
Release <0.3.0>

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulhocker.kick-assembler-vscode-ext


First up, the extension will now check what version of Kick you are running, and will inform you if your version is not supported, too old or when a newer version is available. It also provides a convenient button for you to take you to the website to download the latest version.


Another great addition is the ability to add additional paths in your project when you want to get external code libraries. This will then add those to the `-libdir` path when you compile your project.
