Kick Assembler (C64) For Visual Studio Code
Release 0.3.3

@Lubber has taken the 0.3.3 release to Warp Speed by adding definition linking to macros, functions, labels and files that are included in your projects.

We also smashed a few bugs, especially that nasty one that was causing issues for our Mac and Linux users that had spaces in the settings for some of the paths in the extension.

Much more to come, check the roadmap, and let us know if there is something else you would like to be added by sending us a note on Facebook or creating an [Issue](https://gitlab.com/retro-coder/commodore/kick-assembler-vscode-ext/issues) on the project page.
