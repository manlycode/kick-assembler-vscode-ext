A [Kick Assembler](http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html#frontpage) extension for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

**This extension is a work in progress and many features are not completed, and some might even be broken.**

## Feature Summary
* build, run and debug commands
* support for emulators like [VICE](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/) and the [C64Debugger](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=170893)
* auto completion (intellisense)
* syntax highlighting
* error checking
* hover Support
* code outline
* code snippets
* illegal opcode support

## Feature Details
The following features are currently working relatively well.

### Editing

This extension provides a lot of features to make your coding life easier with Kick Assembler.

#### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting for every element in your code.

#### Code Outline

See an outline of your current source code, and jump to those items in your code.

#### Imported File Support

Code completion for all of your code files for the `.import` and `#import` directives.

Any imported files will have their variables, macros and functions available in auto completion for your current file. The heading of the hover will let you know which file the item was imported from.

#### Error Checking

Real time syntax checking of your code by using information from the Kick Assembler compiler.

#### Code Folding

### Hover Support

Hover support has been added to help you with your daily coding. From simple things like a comment on your variable or macro, to more useful things like variable values and even support to show you high and low byte values in your code.

#### Comments

Most comments for defined variables, macros and functions are captured and displayed as a comment. There is some very basic MARKDOWN support so that you can include things like parameters in your comments.

#### Values

Most values will give you comments about the variable itself, but also decimal, hex and binary values as well.

#### Hi/Lo Byte Values

Useful when creating jump tables.

#### Additional/Illegal Opcodes

Additional opcodes for 65c02, DTV and Illegal opcodes supported. Be a Rebel!

#### Support For `-libdir` Option

Work with external code libraries in your project, and then ensure they are added to your compile using the `-libdir` parameter on Kick.
