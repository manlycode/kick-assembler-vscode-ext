# Release Notes
## v0.4.6

And a big thank you to everyone using the extension. Your feedback, ideas and bug reports are making this tool better every day.

This release we have a few new things to tell you about. 

This is a small release to handle the newest version of KickAssembler 5.13. There was a small problem with some imported files not beeing found which was causing the extension to fail. @Lubber added an enhancement to the NAMESPACE functionality to include symbols that might be part of a NAMESPACE in several different locations.

For a full list of changes, please see the projects [History](HISTORY.md) file.

Much more to come, check the roadmap, and let us know if there is something else you would like to be added by sending us a note on Facebook or creating an [Issue](https://gitlab.com/retro-coder/commodore/kick-assembler-vscode-ext/issues) on the project page.

Enjoy the new release!
