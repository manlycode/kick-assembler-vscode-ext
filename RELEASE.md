# Release Notes
## v0.4.5

And a big thank you to everyone using the extension. Your feedback, ideas and bug reports are making this tool better every day.

This release we have a few new things to tell you about. 

First, is the long awaited support for pseudocommands. This is a huge add from @Lubber. It is still in it's infancy, but it functioning and will have more support for parameters and such very soon.

A weird bug with the `.print` directive was corrected. It was showing some ghosting some of it's parts to random parts of the editor. Thanks to @Lubber for fixing this too.

And last, @Lubber has added some support for when a name has been defined multiple times. The editor will now show you where else that name might be from and let you go to it's definition. Very handy!

Last, we can thank @d23 for fixing the setting keepWorkFile, we hope once and for all.

Enjoy the new release!
