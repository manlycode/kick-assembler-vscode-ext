# Release Notes

## v0.2.6

This release was focused on a few bugs as well as improving the README file that is displayed on the Marketplace. This should give developers a better idea of what is available in the extension.

Of note in this release is the addition of making sure that code completion is working correctly when it is enabled. In most cases labels and variables were not showing up in the completion list.

Also keep in mind that this feature will not even work unless you have the editor setting "editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions" disabled.
