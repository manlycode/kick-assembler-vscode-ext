## v0.3.1

This small release fixes a number of small bugs that were found in the 0.3.0 release last week. In addition to these, a couple of nifty features were added by @Lubber.

First up, the extension will now check what version of Kick you are running, and will inform you if your version is not supported, too old or when a newer version is available. It also provides a convenient button for you to take you to the website to download the latest version.

Another great addition is the ability to add additional paths in your project when you want to get external code libraries. This will then add those to the `-libdir` path when you compile your project.

And a big thank you to everyone using the extension. Your feedback and bug reports are making this tool better.
