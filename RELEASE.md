# Release Notes
## v0.4.8

And a big thank you to everyone using the extension. Your feedback, ideas and bug reports are making this tool better every day.

```
This release fixes a bug in Windows when the source code was located on a different drive other than c: it would fail building because the source could not be found. Thanks to Ian C and Lee H for helping diagnose the problem.
```

For a full list of changes, please see the projects [History](HISTORY.md) file.

Much more to come, check the roadmap, and let us know if there is something else you would like to be added by sending us a note on Facebook or creating an [Issue](https://gitlab.com/retro-coder/commodore/kick-assembler-vscode-ext/issues) on the project page.

Enjoy the new release!
