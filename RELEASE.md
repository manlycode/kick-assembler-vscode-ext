# Release Notes
## v0.4.3

And a big thank you to everyone using the extension. Your feedback, ideas and bug reports are making this tool better every day.

This is a small bug release version.

There were a number of error messages showing up when the startup project was located in a subfolder in the workspace. This caused things like Hover and Completion to fail.

Marco fixed a small bug with the `.print` statement not adding it as a log entry.

For a full list of changes, please see the projects [History](HISTORY.md) file.

Much more to come, check the roadmap, and let us know if there is something else you would like to be added by sending us a note on Facebook or creating an [Issue](https://gitlab.com/retro-coder/commodore/kick-assembler-vscode-ext/issues) on the project page.

Cheers!
